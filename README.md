# Personal Weather Dashboard

## Check out the [live dashboard](https://lshillman.github.io/personal-weather-dashboard/)

I like knowing the weather, and I dislike using Google (only half joking about that last part. A company with that much power shouldn't also control the WEATHER!). Anyway, I needed some practice with third-party APIs, so this seemed like a good idea at the time. Search for your city on the page, and your search history is saved in localStorage so you can easily come back to it later.


## Technologies used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Bootstrap
* OpenWeather One Call API
